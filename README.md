Most of what I created is contained here.

But the earliest history is lost.

Currently my Solution is built for import to a trial account of Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Applications. (https://trials.dynamics.com/ then follow small print links for 'using this trial for development purposes'). However, recent trial accounts are provisioned differently, which has broken my deployment process.

TODO: I plan on recovering some of these older items that I lost.
 - I lost a Ribbon button that is in an older version of the Dynamics solutions. 
 - I lost a Business Process Flow and a custom Workflow.
 - I lost some Business Rules that work with the Web Resources in the Contacts form.
